### 👋 Hey!

I'm raf, more commonly known as NotAShelf on various parts of the world wide
web. I am a sailor, sailmaker, political scientist and an academic. FOSS
contributor and digital artist when stars align.

Ever since my introduction to the world of FOSS and Linux in late 2010s, I have
been very passionate about **operating systems**, **open-source software** and
**system administration**. I am also interested in the role of information
system and data integrity/privacy within the policymaking process in
contemporary politics, which I have decided to base my PhD thesis on.

Most of my code here are solutions to small itches, or my answers to different
curiosities. Exploring solutions to known pain points in software and home-made
CLI applications to manage different components of my setup are some of my
pastime activities. **Reliable** and **scalable** systems are also within my
interest. I work with and contribute to [@NixOS] in my free time to help me
towards this goal. Take a look at the [projects section](#-currently-working-on)
below for a somewhat curated list of what I'm currently working on

There are many means to my ends; I work with any and all languages or tools that
I find interesting. My experience and knowledge (both in _very_ heavy quotes)
span over multiple languages, tools and frameworks, however, my primary focus
remains as **C** and **Rust** (or sometimes **Go**) for building reliable
backend applications alongside some **Typescript** for frontend. I also rely on
**Nix** infrastructure, deployments and distributing software. See below for a
list of languages and tools that I work, or have worked with before.

I also take part of the [Hyprland] community, playing an active role in
community management and acting as a supporting developer for Nix. Do feel free
to contact me for either of those matters.

<!-- The "overrated" section every bio really needs -->

- 📅 Programming since 2018
- ⛵ Professional Sailor
- 🏫 Part-time Political Scientist and lecturer, forever student
- 🖥️ NixOS / Hyprland / Neovim
- 🔧 Despite its shortcomings, Go is my _go-to_ language (pun _fully_ intended)
- 🌐 Frontend via React/NextJS used to be my primary stack, now I focus on
  backend applications, applications security and system administration.
- ❄️ NixOS remains my favorite Linux distro for both personal and enterprise
  use. I manage my own fleet of servers and virtual machines powered by it.
- 📫 Contact me by email via `raf [at] notashelf [dot] dev` or on Discord, by
  sending a friend request to `@notashelf` I'm also available on Matrix, though
  downtimes may occur on my homeserver...
- 🎲 Fun fact: I have entered the world of Linux, programming and OSS through a
  lengthy misadventure back in 2018 that involved a Linux VPS, a large-scale
  Minecraft server and an imminent crisis. I have been passionate about Linux
  and programming ever since.

### 🔭 Projects

I have many projects, usually fruits of my most recent obsession. Almost all of
them are bootstrapped with Nix, but languages vary. Note that I am currently in
the process of moving beloved projects out of Github. You will not be affected
by this, but let me know if you are.

Below is a poorly updated chart of my languages. Some of them are exluded, for
reasons unknown... In addition to what's already here, I also work with **R**,
**Ruby**, **Kotlin** and copious amounts of Typescript code that I have never
uploaded to Github.
