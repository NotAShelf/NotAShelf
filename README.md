<h1 align="center">Hello thereðŸ‘‹, I'm NotAShelf</h1>


<p align="center">I so happen to be introduced to JavaScript in the earliest stages of my interest in programming, or scripting, thus it is the language I use the most. Even though some projects can be more efficent in different languages, I am very likely to torture myself with JavaScript. If you don't believe me, check my *now private* 24 repositories and see. So JavaScript,  I hate it.<p align="center"> Most of my projects are forks, or things heavily inspired by some things I have seen and decided to improve. With this philosophy, I do appreciate ALL contributions made to **MY**  work. </p>

<h2 align="center"> About the man, the legend himself NotAShelf</h2>



<p align= "center"> I'm a simple man, with simple hobbies. Some of the things I like are sailing, reading, watching movies, mountain climbing and video games. There are many more but I feel like just those suffice for now. I must mention that I am also into programming. Not *that* much but I so happen to find it absurdly interesting to create applications that automate a lot of things for you. That is most likely the reason I'm using GitHub while all my projects are closed source. Did I say I appreciate contributions? Yes? No. Why yes, but you need to find an open-source repository of mine first. Good luck.<p>
<p align="center"> Another thing you might want to know about me is that I like memes. I mean it's not cool putting it as "hey I like memes" but I find them as a good way to communicate as I possess a terribe sense of humor. Hmm? Am I hearing you ask whether I have a repository for memes? Why yes, yes I do. You can find it [here](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io) but honestly, why would you?
