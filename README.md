### üëã Hey!

<!-- Those don't have to be in-line. Glad to have learned that -->

I'm raf, more commonly known as NotAShelf on various parts of the world wide
web. I am a sailor, sailmaker, political scientist and an academic. FOSS
contributor and digital artist when stars align.

Ever since my introduction to the world of FOSS and Linux in late 2010s, I have
been very passionate about **operating systems**, **open-source software** and
**system administration**. I am also interested in the role of information
system and data integrity/privacy within the policymaking process in
contemporary politics, which I have decided to base my PhD thesis on.

Most of my code here are
[solutions to small itches](https://github.com/NotAShelf/licenseit), or my
answers to different curiosities. Exploring solutions to known pain points in
software and home-made CLI applications to manage different components of my
setup are some of my pastime activities. **Reliable** and **scalable** systems
are also within my interest. I work with and contribute to [@NixOS] in my free
time to help me towards this goal. Sometimes I write about Nix and NixOS (among
other things) on [my blog].

<!-- Blogposts section
     That's right, I write. I write about Nix.

There are many means to my ends; I work with any and all languages or tools that
I find interesting. My experience and knowledge (both in _very_ heavy quotes)
span over multiple languages, tools and frameworks, however, my primary focus
remains as **C** and **Rust** (or sometimes **Go**) for building reliable
backend applications alongside some **Typescript** for frontend. I also rely on
**Nix** infrastructure, deployments and distributing software. See below for a
list of languages and tools that I work, or have worked with before. Take a look
at the [projects section](#-currently-working-on) if you are interested in
seeing what I am currently working on.

I also take part of the [Hyprland] community, playing an active role in
community management and acting as a supporting developer for Nix. Do feel free
to [contact me](#-how-to-reach-me) for either of those matters.

<!-- The "overrated" section every bio really needs -->

- üìÖ Programming since 2018
- ‚õµ Professional Sailor
- üè´ Part-time Political Scientist and lecturer, forever student
- üñ•Ô∏è NixOS / Hyprland / Neovim
- üîß Despite its shortcomings, Go is my _go-to_ language (pun _fully_ intended)
- üåê Frontend via React/NextJS used to be my primary stack, now I focus on
  backend applications, applications security and system administration.
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è NixOS remains my favorite Linux distro for both personal and enterprise
  use. I manage my own fleet of servers and virtual machines powered by it.
- üì´ Contact me by email via `raf [at] notashelf [dot] dev` or on Discord, by
  sending a friend request to `@notashelf` I'm also available on Matrix, though
  downtimes may occur on my homeserver...
- üé≤ Fun fact: I have entered the world of Linux, programming and OSS through a
  lengthy misadventure back in 2018 that involved a Linux VPS, a large-scale
  Minecraft server and an imminent crisis. I have been passionate about Linux
  and programming ever since.

### üî≠ Projects

I have many projects, usually fruits of my most recent obsession. Almost all of
them are bootstrapped with Nix, but languages vary. Note that I am currently in
the process of moving beloved projects out of Github. You will not be affected
by this, but let me know if you are.

Below is a poorly updated chart of my languages. Some of them are exluded, for
reasons unknown... In addition to what's already here, I also work with **R**,
**Ruby**, **Kotlin** and copious amounts of Typescript code that I have never
uploaded to Github.
